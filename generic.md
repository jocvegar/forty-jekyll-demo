# I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.

I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. I'm really more an apartment person. He taught me a code. To survive. I like seafood. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.

Makes me a … scientist. I'm generally confused most of the time. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before. __I have a dark side, too.__ *I'm real proud of you for coming, bro.* I know you hate funerals.

## Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.

Hello, Dexter Morgan. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Cops, another community I'm not part of.

1. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.
2. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.
3. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask … not just me.
