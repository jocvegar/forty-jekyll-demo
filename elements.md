<h1>Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love!</h1>
<p>You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity. Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city!</p>
<p>Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems. Me fail English? That's unpossible. <strong> And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker.</strong> <em> That's why I love elementary school, Edna.</em> The children believe anything you tell them.</p>
<h2>Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns."</h2>
<p>Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!" I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it.</p>
<p>I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.</p>
<h3>Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies.</h3>
<p>Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world. A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner.</p>
<p>Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer? Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!</p>
<p>I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. I didn't get rich by signing checks. Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk. Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns."</p>
<p>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… Me fail English? That's unpossible. Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! Beer. Now there's a temporary solution.</p>
<p>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. Homer no function beer well without.</p>
